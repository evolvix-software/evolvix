# Install Redux Dependencies

To complete the Redux setup, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Install Redux Toolkit and React Redux
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit@^2.9.2 react-redux@^9.2.0

# Or if you prefer yarn
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit@^2.9.2 react-redux@^9.2.0
```

## After Installation

Once the dependencies are installed, you can restore the full Redux functionality by:

1. **Update StoreProvider.tsx**:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   
   import { ReactNode } from 'react';
   import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
   import { store } from '@/store';
   
   interface StoreProviderProps {
     children: ReactNode;
   }
   
   export function StoreProvider({ children }: StoreProviderProps) {
     return <Provider store={store}>{children}</Provider>;
   }
   ```

2. **Update signin page** to use Redux hooks:
   ```tsx
   import { useAppDispatch, useAppSelector } from '@/store/hooks';
   import { loginStart, loginSuccess, loginFailure } from '@/store/features/auth/authSlice';
   ```

3. **Update dashboard page** to use Redux state:
   ```tsx
   import { useAppSelector, useAppDispatch } from '@/store/hooks';
   import { logout } from '@/store/features/auth/authSlice';
   ```

## Current Status

The application is currently working with:
- ✅ Beautiful signin page
- ✅ Mock authentication (no Redux)
- ✅ Dashboard with mock user data
- ✅ Clean, organized component structure
- ✅ Beautiful UI with white/black theme and blue primary color

The Redux store is ready and waiting - just needs the dependencies installed!
